I am a PhD candidate in the College of Information and Computer Science, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, working with Dr. Ina Fiterau in InFusion lab. Prior to UMass, I worked as a software engineer at IBM Research Africa, in Nairobi, Kenya. My undergraduate degree was in Computer Science at University of Nairobi, Kenya. 

My research is at the intesection of Data Science and Healthcare. Specifically, I leverage Statistics and Machine Learning to improve health equity. To this end, I build systems that:

  - automatically extract comprable cohorts from multiple electronic health datasets
  - determine whether there are statistically significant differences in treatment of those chorts
  - attempt to generalize any differences across multiple datasets
  - integrate social determinants of health with a twofold goal: to improve prediction performance, and, to personalize models to patient subgroups
